I am actively developing my business skills and gaining a comprehensive understanding of our assigned group and its integration within our company's broader structure. As part of the group working on the wellbeing portal, I am focused on building a portal to assess and evaluate employees' overall wellbeing on several aspects through which I aim to enhance my knowledge of how these dimensions contribute to the overall success and productivity of our organization, while also fostering a positive and supportive work environment.

Whenever I needed assistance, I contacted my fellow interns and colleagues, especially Sumit Shinde. For help with the project's backend, I connected with Harsh Lohana, Priyanka Shah, Rudra Singh, Radha Prasanthi and Vaishnavi Dala, who helped me throughout the process of setting up and developing.

I am dedicated to upholding Barclays' respect, integrity, service, excellence, and stewardship values. I demonstrate these values in every aspect of my work by fostering a culture of trust and professionalism. With an empowering mindset, I embrace challenges and strive for exceptional results. I aim to contribute to our success while maintaining ethical standards and service excellence.

I am making significant progress in establishing an efficient control environment by thoroughly comprehending the factors that drive risks, carefully following the escalation processes, and adhering diligently to the bank's policies, procedures, and practices. I take a proactive stance in identifying potential risks and implementing appropriate measures to mitigate them, demonstrating a proactive approach to risk management.


Throughout my internship, I have had the opportunity to work on both back-end and front-end aspects. It has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to gain practical skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization. I have enjoyed diving into the topic of child malnutrition in India, exploring relevant factors and conducting research. Moving forward, I aim to further enhance my skills and knowledge, tackle new challenges, and propose actionable interventions based on the data. Overall, I am grateful for the experience and excited to continue making progress in the remaining period of my internship.
